# LearnSFML

#### Author: Jack Fraser

This project was meant to help me learn how to write SFML. It is a simple
sorting algorithm visualizer that has implemented a bubble sort and displays
its process using vertical bars whose heights represent the values being
sorted.

### How to run:

1. Clone repository to your machine
2. Make sure you have CMake and SFML installed
3. Compile using cmake (VSCode CMake extension can make this very simple)
4. Run the executable (./build/LearnSFML or run button from VSCode CMake extension)

### Dependencies:

* CMake
* SFML
* VSCode and CMake extension (optional)
